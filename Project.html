                        He assigned us to do a poem for our ILS project in 21st Century Literature for our spoken poetry. We made the project in our classroom and in the comfort of our houses. But one member contributed the most and it was our classmate Joshua V. Ocbina who did the most part in assembling and writing the poem for our ILS project in 21st Century Literature. What he did was he took some inspiration from lines of poems, lyrics, and songs. He added and change the poem, lines, and stanza for our topic was "Computer Genius". Then after he assembled our poem it took days for us to review and proofread it. We also reviewed our sir to the poem and we took notes of the correction that he did that will make our poem the final piece. Our poem titled "Computer Genius", was completed after days of assembling and reviewing it was finally time to practice and memorize our piece. It also took us days to add actions and dramatization of words for it to be complete. The outcome was a success the poem was approved by sir Gab Silao and we got to perform our poem upstage.</p>

                        In our first quarter ILS he task as to perform the peom that we made on our  other subject which is 21st century literature the performance is in a form of speech choir / sabayang pagbigkas its our job to add movements and appropriate emotion in each line and stanza of our peom. What we did first is to find the right emotion for each stanza which we found very quick the next step is to make movements, for this step we struggled we didn't to find our flow and didn't not made a successful choreography until the day of our performance. So with our efforts and wanting to have a good grade we pushed through and made decent enough of a "performance". The people's who made most efforts of making our choreography was John Carlo Flores one of our member and our leader Joshuo V. Ocbina. The outcome of our last minute brain storming represented our final output which is 3rd/last place in our class. We learned that planning and sticking to a idea is important and not changing once a person comes up with a new idea is sometimes not the best of ideas or plan of actions</p>

                        He assigned us to do Zumba in 1st Quarter and INDAC in 2nd Quarter. Zumba involved us in doing more cardio, and exercise. While INDAC  requires much more dance and footwork.Each ILS project in P.E requires us to practice for each step, which we mainly do at school. Our classroom is commonly used for practice, and MH or Multi-Purpose Hall is our second choice to practice the project. Sometimes we had to practice outside of school which requires us to meet up and practice in a safe environment outside of school. We made the ILS project possible by practicing at any time we were available and free. Practicing hard made the project possible. The people that contributed to this project is everyone, each and every one of our group mates did each their part to teach and guide us on the steps. The outcome was successful because of the days we spent practicing the steps, and dance that made us perform smoothly in Zumba, and INDAC.</p>

                        The project of General Mathematics is about making a Graphic figure that using any tools or equipment for making a figure, but u need to know the function so u know where to put the joints of  the figure like among us every line there is a pin so every pin should have a yarn so i will look like among us but there is a meaning function code type. But the other thing is where did we built this figure it is from Makati city in a Hotel rooftop from our leader and other than that of course where we get the tools or equipment to this figure first of all of the members give budget money except 2 members because they are lazy then the half of the group but it from Market-market and all of the members contributed mostly other members  is busy or just laze finally the outcome of the figure we built is Good not perfect but good because before we built the figure we don't have any time so that's why it is not good enough for our project.</p>

                        In a classmate's home close to the school, we are working on this project.
                        Without images, a storyboard would not be a storyboard. Once the specifics of each photo have been established, it is essential to upload an image that graphically illustrates each shot. These pictures can be rough drawings, photographs that we've collected for inspiration on our mood board, or images that have a similar frame or pose to the one you want. The scenario, setting, and description of any action we are all described in a storyboard. It also includes details on any necessary camera gear or operating procedures.
                        Geoffrie Balahadia, Jacob Bautista, John Carlo Flores, Jomari Guinto, Mark Henry Berame, Marzk Torio, Joshua Ocbina, Precious Laharey, and Wynzor Jimenez all made contributions to the project.
                        The storyboard about a game addict is the project's final product.</p>

                        We made our project by researching the Quezon city place, like how many people who're addicted to games, and we also research the people who live there, and the Government of Quezon City.
                        Most of us helped... But the others have their own different world, tho we did great in our output
